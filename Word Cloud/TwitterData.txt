 Halting funding for the World Health Organization during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds. Their work is slowing the spread of COVID-19 and if that work is stopped no other organization can replace them. The world needs @WHO now more than ever.
 .@NickKristof does an amazing job capturing the heroism of the health care workers on the front lines of the coronavirus fight. https://t.co/x1TgE2oNXE
 On #WorldHealthDay — and every day — I want to thank all of the health heroes for their sacrifices and for keeping us safe. https://t.co/0x9QFSrlQb
 I always enjoy chatting with @Trevornoah, even though we had to sit a little bit further apart than usual this time. https://t.co/aqwtN1tS2p
 It’s encouraging to see the first projects begin from our effort to accelerate safe and effective drugs for #COVID19. https://t.co/UH66MrAYcV
 I’m excited to join the @khanacademy Daily Homeroom today to talk about the incredible ways parents, teachers, and students are coming together to keep learning while schools are closed. https://t.co/faMTkwl97g
 If we make the right decisions now—informed by science, data and the experience of medical professionals—we can save lives and get the country back to work. You can read more about my thoughts on #COVID19 on my blog. https://t.co/KN58B8Hs11
 In the meantime, frontline health care workers are making heroic efforts to test and treat patients across the United States and the world. Here in my hometown, Public Health Seattle &amp; King County (@KCPubHealth) is doing incredible work that we should all be very proud of.
 All the work that rich countries are doing now to develop vaccines will save lives in developing countries too. Without a vaccine, those countries are at even greater risk than wealthy ones, because it’s even harder for them to do physical distancing and shutdowns.
 If everything goes well, there might be an effective vaccine in less than 18 months—the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. That will depend on decisions we make today, including the federal government investing in building up manufacturing capacity.
 Work is going full speed on potential treatments, and vaccines. But people should know that it will take time to prove they are safe and effective and to start making them.
 There’s been some progress on more efficient testing methods, such as the self-swab developed by the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network. I hope this and other innovations in testing are scaled up across the country soon. https://t.co/qdrr7Qz16r
 The federal government needs to step up on testing: far more tests should be made available, and we should aggregate the results so we can quickly identify potential volunteers for clinical trials and know with confidence when it’s time to return to normal.
 Extreme physical distancing measures will make a big difference in the U.S., but we need a consistent nationwide approach. Until the case numbers start to go down across America—which could take 10 weeks or more—no one can continue business as usual or relax the shutdown.
 There’s no question the United States missed the opportunity to get ahead of the novel #coronavirus. But the window for making important decisions hasn’t closed. The choices we and our leaders make now will have an enormous impact. https://t.co/mAa2XWwBIB
 I’m inspired by the generosity of everyone who has contributed to this effort to help keep kids learning at home. Thank you to @DonorsChoose and especially the educators who are doing amazing things for their students every day. https://t.co/aiMSYWTsDg

 Tuberculosis is still the leading infectious cause of death worldwide. To #EndTB, we need to continue to develop safer and simpler solutions. The FDA’s approval of a new treatment is a promising step in the right direction. https://t.co/dJQapVKgjW
 Whenever I hear an idea for what we can do to keep global warming in check, I always ask this question: “What’s your plan for steel?” 

I know it sounds like an odd thing to say, but it opens the door to a very important subject. https://t.co/Oo20WYmkAZ
 Germany, Italy, and the European Commission have demonstrated great leadership with their commitments to the @GlobalFund. Thank you @BMZ_Bund, @GiuseppeConteIT and @EU_Commission. Your pledges will help protect the world’s most vulnerable from #AIDS, #TB, and #malaria. https://t.co/gfu5ovysf2

 Being poor isn’t cheap. It’s hundreds of times more expensive to use charging stations than it is to charge a phone at home. That’s just one of the hidden costs of unreliable electricity: https://t.co/1RTxaL1chd https://t.co/ymKCJo83em
 Whenever I want to understand something better, I pick up a book. Here are some of the best ones I’ve read so far this year: https://t.co/Q9RFZW6uid #BookLoversDay https://t.co/wwg8lsG3jI
 There is no question that reliable electricity unlocks a better life for people. But can we power the world without contributing to climate change? I think we can: https://t.co/33sGjLspfT https://t.co/NRjXc2HReH
 Think back to the last time you experienced a power outage. If you live in New York, you don’t have to think that far back! Now imagine what it would be like not to have access to electricity at all. Nearly one billion people face that reality every day. https://t.co/4jg2JC7EVQ
 Five years ago, India was declared polio-free. This incredible milestone was made possible by the health workers, governments, partners, and donors who didn’t rest until every child was reached. I can’t wait to see what India achieves next. https://t.co/p5G2WuwPZb
